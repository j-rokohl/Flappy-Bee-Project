# Java Project: Flappy Bee

I created "Flappy Bee" for this year's Multimedia Fair. "Flappy Bee" is a remix of Flappy Bird but with a bee instead of the bird, vines instead of the pipes, and a flower field background instead of the city background. 

I designed all of the pixel art on Canva and typed the code. This was not my original code. This was from Kenny Yip's coding channel on YouTube. I also made this description too. 

My mom did help me out with setting things up and wrote some of the code. 

## How to Play

This game might be hard, so try to be fast when playing! 

### Controls

For Flappy Bee to jump, press space. If you want to go lower, let gravity do it's thing. Try to not touch the vines or the ground, or the game will restart. 

## Making the Game

This whole game was coded usin Java and a code editor called Visual Studio Code, while Canva was for the graphics.
